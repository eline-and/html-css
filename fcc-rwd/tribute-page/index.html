                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1834</strong> - Founds the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad, with the goal of aiding Christian schools and missionaries; distributing the Bible and Christian tracts; and providing Day-schools, Sunday-schools
                            and Adult-schools, all upon a Scriptural foundation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1836</strong> - The work of Müller and his wife with orphans began with the preparation of their own rented home at 6 Wilson Street, Bristol for the accommodation of thirty girls. Soon after, three more houses in Wilson
                            Street were furnished, not only for girls but also for boys and younger children, eventually increasing the capacity for children who could be cared for to 130. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

            <p class="quote"><em>"He was poor when he projected his first orphanage for the sustenance of half a dozen waifs; since then he has collected and spent six or seven millions of dollars in his kindly work, and is as poor to-day as he was when he started.
                He has built five great orphanages; in them he clothes and teaches and feeds two thousand children at a cost of a hundred thousand dollars a year, and England furnishes the money—not through solicitation, nor advertising, nor any kind
                of prodding, but by distinctly voluntary contributions. When money runs short Müller prays—not publicly but privately—and his treasury is replenished."</p>
